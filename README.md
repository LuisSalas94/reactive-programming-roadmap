# ⚡ Reactive Programming in Java

This repository is a complete, hands-on guide to **Reactive Programming in Java** using **Project Reactor**. It teaches the core concepts, patterns, and best practices for building responsive, scalable, and asynchronous applications. You’ll find detailed explanations, real-world code samples, and practical modules designed to help you think reactively.

I'm also preparing a full companion **Medium article** and an in-depth **YouTube walkthrough** on my channel [`<CodeWithFernando/>`](https://youtube.com/@CodeWithFernando), so you can **learn by reading or watching** — whichever suits your style.

## 📘 What Is Reactive Programming?

Reactive Programming is a paradigm for writing non-blocking, asynchronous systems that can handle a high volume of data and events with minimal resource usage. It’s built around the idea of **data streams**, **event propagation**, and **backpressure-aware** execution.

---

## 🚀 Why Reactive Programming?

Reactive systems are essential for building modern applications that are:

- 🔄 **Responsive** – react quickly to user interactions and system events  
- 📶 **Resilient** – gracefully handle failures, retries, and timeouts  
- 📈 **Scalable** – serve large volumes of concurrent users with fewer threads  
- 🔍 **Observable** – offer better traceability and debugging through signal flow

Reactive programming allows you to build applications that are **predictable under load**, **composable**, and **testable by design**.

## 📂 What You'll Learn

Each module is crafted with real-world examples (like book stores and APIs), covering topics such as:

- Mono and Flux: Reactive data types and their lifecycles  
- Operators: Transforming, filtering, and combining data streams  
- Sequence transformations: `flatMap`, `concatMap`, `zip`, and more  
- Dynamic stream generation: `Flux.create()`, `Flux.generate()`  
- Error handling and fallbacks  
- Testing with `StepVerifier`  
- Common pitfalls and best practices

---

## 🧪 Technologies Used

- **Java 17+**  
- **Project Reactor (reactor-core, reactor-test)**  
- **Maven or Gradle**  
- **JUnit 5**
